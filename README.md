Simply put, customer churn occurs when customers or subscribers stop doing business with a company or service. Also known as customer attrition, customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain 
existing customers than it is to acquire new customers – earning business from new customers means working leads all the way through the sales funnel, utilizing your marketing and sales resources throughout the process. 
Customer retention, on the other hand, is generally more cost-effective as you’ve already earned the trust and loyalty of existing customers.

Customer churn impedes growth, so companies should have a defined method for calculating customer churn in a given period of time. By being aware of and monitoring churn rate, organizations are equipped to determine their customer 
retention success rates and identify strategies for improvement.

I made an exploratory data analysis project using this data set.
